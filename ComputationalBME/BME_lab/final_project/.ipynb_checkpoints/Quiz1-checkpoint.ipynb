The model would need to be retrained with some kid data so it can more accuratly represent this new range. A normalizing method could also be used to put the heart rate into an adult range\n",
    "    2) Lactate levels are diffrent in kids vs adults. Loking at this paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1332314/, we see that puberty effects how lactate is held in the blood, so the model could also need to be adjusted for this. \n",
    "    3) generally blood pressure is lower in kids than adults, so the blood pressure should also be adjusted or the model retrained on kids data. \n",
